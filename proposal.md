# Major Project Propoasal

## Project Description

i am going to continue working on my puzzle game and try to make it look and feel like a finished game, including custom music, graphics, and many levels.

## Needs to have

-reset button
-better player movement
-main menu
-level select
-game updates on player input rather than every frame (easier for new features)

## Nice to have

-ability to hold down movement keys rather than repeatedly hitting them
-custom sprites and music
-sprites displayed above grid for smooth movement
-undo button
-more levels
-more mechanics (rails, more box types?)

## Project Description

there was an ASCII project in the exemplars that really captivated me, and i would like to try and imitate that with my limited knowledge. this includes providing several things that can be done with it, though they would not be the same as the original.

## Needs to have

-a renderer that can display ASCII art
-at least one thing to display in the renderer

## Nice to have

-multipule things to display
-in browser way to switch between peices
-player interaction -->
