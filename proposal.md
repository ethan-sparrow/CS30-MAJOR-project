# Major Project Propoasal

## Project Description

i am going to continue working on my puzzle game and try to make it look and feel like a finished game, including custom music, graphics, and many levels.

## Needs to have

- / sprites
-   music 
- / reset button 
- / better player movement (no more wierd interactions when next to other players) 
- / main menu 
- / level select 
- / game updates on player input rather than every frame (easier for new features) 

## Nice to have

-   ability to hold down movement keys rather than repeatedly hitting them 
-   CUSTOM sprites and music
-   sprites displayed above grid for smooth movement and idle animation
- / undo button 
-   more levels
- / more mechanics (rails, more box types?)

## A note

this project has been fun, but i think more forsight would have made it alot easier and allowed me to complete more of my Nice to have list. for example, it would have been great to make the game object have classes or something other than storing what they are only in the cells. i dont regret making it that way though, because now i know better.
