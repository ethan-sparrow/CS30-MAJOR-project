# Major Project Propoasal

## Project Description

i am going to continue working on my puzzle game and try to make it look and feel like a finished game, including custom music, graphics, and many levels.

## Needs to have

- sprites and music
- reset button /
- better player movement (no more wierd interactions when next to other players) /
- main menu
- level select
- game updates on player input rather than every frame (easier for new features) /

## Nice to have

- ability to hold down movement keys rather than repeatedly hitting them
- CUSTOM sprites and music
- sprites displayed above grid for smooth movement and idle animation
- undo button
- more levels
- more mechanics (rails, more box types?)

<!-- ## OR, option 2

-at least one thing to display in the renderer
