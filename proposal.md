# Major Project Propoasal

## Project Description

i am going to continue working on my puzzle game and try to make it look and feel like a finished game, including custom music, graphics, and many levels.

## Needs to have

- sprites and music /
- reset button //
- better player movement (no more wierd interactions when next to other players) //
- main menu //
- level select //
- game updates on player input rather than every frame (easier for new features) //

## Nice to have

- ability to hold down movement keys rather than repeatedly hitting them
- CUSTOM sprites and music
- sprites displayed above grid for smooth movement and idle animation
- undo button //
- more levels
- more mechanics (rails, more box types?)
